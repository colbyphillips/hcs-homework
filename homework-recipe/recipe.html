      <h2>Homemade Blueberry Pancakes are easier than you think!</h2>
      <p class="intro">
        Imagine a light fluffy pancake, with gorgeous, sweet blueberries
        throughout, topped with a healthy drizzle of maple syrup. Seriously,
        does breakfast food get any better? These pancakes are golden and
        lightly crisp at the edges, with a soft, tender center. Blueberry
        Pancakes with fresh blueberries are most definitely not just for special
        occasions!
      </p>

      <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
      <ul class="ingredients">
        <li>2 cups all purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons baking flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons light brown sugar</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups milk</li>
        <li>5 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
        <li>2 cups fresh blueberries</li>
        <li>butter for frying</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>How Do You Make Blueberry Pancakes?</h2>
      <article class="article-1">
        <p id="step1">
          Step 1.) In a large bowl whisk the flour, baking powder, salt and
          brown sugar together.
        </p>
        <p id="step2">
          Step 2.) In separate bowl whisk the eggs, vanilla and milk together.
        </p>
        <p id="step3">
          Step 3.) Add the wet ingredients into the dry and mix until just
          combined. Lastly mix in the melted butter and stir until combined, the
          batter will be slightly lumpy. Set the batter aside while you heat
          your griddle to medium-low heat. Melt a small pat of butter on the
          griddle and then scoop out 1/4 cup of pancake batter onto the hot
          griddle and top evenly with blueberries, as many or few as you prefer.
        </p>
        <p id="step4">
          Step 4.) Cook until the edges are set and bubbles form on top of the
          pancake. Flip and cook until browned.
        </p>
        <p id="step5">Step 5.) Serve warm.</p>

      <h2>Tips For Success:</h2>
      <article class="tips">
        <p>
          - You can use frozen (and thawed) blueberries in this recipe, if
          blueberries are not in season.
        </p>
        <p>
          - If you prefer a less thick pancake that is a simple fix! Just add in
          a few tablespoons more milk at a time and whisk up until your batter
          is a thinner consistency, resulting in a thinner pancake!
        </p>
        <p>
          - With pancakes I like to cook them on medium-low! Low and slow is the
          way to go! If you cook these pancakes at too high a heat you will burn
          the outsides while the insides are raw. Since they are a thicker
          pancake, you want to make sure they are cooked all the way through!
